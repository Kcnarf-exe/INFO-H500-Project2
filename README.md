Image enhancement

The images beginning with "enhanced" correspond to the enhanced version of the image. The second term following the "enhanced" word described what feature it shows.
For example, the "enhanced_saturation_portrait2.jpg" shows the enhancement of the image "portrait2.jpg" with an effect of saturation. A contrario, "enhanced_vibrance_portrait2.jpg" shows the image using vibrance instead of saturation.
